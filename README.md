12/04/2025 add new UMTX2 exploit.  thanks to idlsauce 
🔹Improved Performance and Success Rate

🔹Reduced latency of calls from ~6ms to ~0.2ms.

🔹Not yielding before the umtx destroy.

🔹The exploit now often completes in 1-3 secs (not 10-60 secs)

-----------------------------------------------------

The exploit code is largely based on the lua implementation by @shahrilnet and @n0llptr: https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader/blob/main/payloads/umtx.lua

The rest of the setup is based on the previous works by @SpecterDev and @ChendoChap: https://github.com/PS5Dev/PS5-UMTX-Jailbreak/

Thank you to them and everyone else who worked on the umtx and psfree exploit!
